# GRPO

## Train a model with rewards, rules, and just enough chaos to make it smarter without losing its mind ðŸ˜„ 

Training a model with GRPO is like teaching a super-smart robot to solve math problems without overheating your computer (or your brain). I use a powerful model called Qwen2.5-7B and run it on 8 giant GPUs, while giving it memory-saving tricks like bfloat16 â€” basically a diet plan for AI. First, check how smart it already is (about 63% accurate), then fine-tune it using GRPO, a method that carefully teaches the model while making sure it doesnâ€™t forget what it already knows or go off the rails. I make it write 42,000 answers, score them, and use those scores to gently guide its learning. Think of it as a very intense but loving bootcamp for a robot that wants to be great at math and code â€” and yes, I track every step like proud AI parents using wandb.
